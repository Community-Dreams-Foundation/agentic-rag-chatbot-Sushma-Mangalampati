# Project Alpha: Overview and Contributions

## Main Contribution

Project Alpha introduces a novel approach to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that combines semantic search with metadata filtering. The key innovation is a two-stage retrieval pipeline: first, candidate chunks are retrieved using dense embeddings; second, a lightweight reranker applies metadata filters (e.g., document type, date) to improve precision.

Key contributions in three bullets:
- **Hybrid retrieval**: We combine BM25 lexical search with dense vector search, achieving 12% improvement over dense-only baselines on the BEIR benchmark.
- **Section-aware chunking**: We propose chunking at semantic boundaries (paragraphs, sections) rather than fixed token windows, reducing citation errors by 23%.
- **Adaptive retrieval**: The system dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved chunks (k) based on query complexity, measured by entropy of the initial retrieval distribution.

## Assumptions and Limitations

Our approach assumes that documents have reasonable structural markup (headings, paragraphs). For unstructured text such as raw logs, performance may degrade. We also assume that the embedding model has been fine-tuned or is at least trained on domain-relevant data; out-of-domain performance was not extensively evaluated.

A concrete experimental detail: On the FiQA benchmark, our method achieved an nDCG@10 of 0.687, compared to 0.612 for the baseline dense retriever. The improvement was statistically significant (p < 0.01) across 5 random seeds.

## Future Work

We plan to extend the approach to multi-hop reasoning and integrate knowledge graphs for entity resolution.
